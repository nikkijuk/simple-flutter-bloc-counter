# simple-flutter-bloc-counter

Please note: none of this is original work of mine, even if I have modified it for my purposes

Thanks for [VGV](https://verygood.ventures/) for providing seed code 

## To reproduce

1. Create flutter test project (Android studio: File/New/New Flutter project)
2. Add needed dependencies to pubspec.yaml (bloc, flutter_bloc, bloc_test)
3. Replace main.dart content with file from this project
4. Add counter_bloc_test.dart from this project

## Bloc counter example in one file

## simple bloc test

https://github.com/nikkijuk/simple-flutter-bloc-counter/blob/main/bloc_counter/test/counter_bloc_test.dart

## original widget tests from flutter test app prove that nothing is broken
